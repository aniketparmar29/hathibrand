        We want our customers to be completely satisfied with their purchases. If for any reason you are not satisfied, we offer a full refund or exchange within 30 days of purchase.

To be eligible for a refund or exchange, the item must be returned in its original condition with all tags and packaging intact. We reserve the right to deny refunds or exchanges for items that show signs of wear, misuse, or damage.

To initiate a refund or exchange, please email us at support@hathibrand.in with your order number and reason for return. We will provide you with a return shipping label and instructions on how to return the item.

Once we receive the returned item, we will inspect it and process the refund or exchange within 5 business days. Refunds will be issued to the original payment method.

If you received a damaged or defective item, please contact us within 7 days of delivery to initiate a return or exchange. We will cover the cost of return shipping in these cases.

Please note that shipping charges are non-refundable, and customers are responsible for the cost of return shipping unless the item is damaged or defective.
